1 What is thermodynamics
 about?
 Youprobably havethis experience; whenyourubyourhandsquickly
 for a few minutes, your hands will start to feel warmer. How is this
 common phenomenon related to thermodynamics? Well, when you
 rub your hands quickly, your muscles do work. This work is then
 converted to heat; therefore, you feel warmer. Heat and work are
 two forms of energy. Work can be converted to heat, as seen in this
 daily example. However, can heat be converted to work? Can we use
 heat to produce work?
 Heat engine is a device that produces work continuously by
 absorbing heat from a high-temperature heat source and rejecting
 the waste heat to a low-temperature heat sink. Since the 17th
 century, various heat engines were invented in an attempt to
 harness work from heat. Figure 1.1.1 illustrates Watt’s engine
 invented by Scottish engineer James Watt in the late 18th century.
 Watt’s engine is one of the most successful early heat engines.
 Its main components are a boiler (not shown in the figure) and a
 condenser, each connecting to a piston-cylinder device. The two
 valves, V and V’, control the flow of steam into and out of the
 cylinder. When valve V opens, valve V’ remains closed. Steam from
 the boiler enters the cylinder, pushing the piston up until it reaches
 the top of the cylinder. Then valve V’ opens, and valve V closes. The
 steam in the cylinder escapes to the condenser and is condensed,
 creating a vacuum in the cylinder. Consequently, the piston moves
 downward under atmospheric pressure. The reciprocating motion
 of the piston drives the pivoting beam DEF, which then powers the
 pump chained to the beam. Watt’s engine demonstrates how heat
 is converted to work. This conversion relies on the phase change of
 a working fluid, e.g., water, in the Watt’s engine. The boiler in the

Watt’s engine is the heat source, where the hot steam is generated;
 and the condenser is the heat sink, where the hot steam is cooled
 and condensed to liquid water. All heat engines need a working fluid
 circulating in a specially-arranged set of equipment, which operates
 between a high-temperature heat source and a low-temperature
 heat sink. Figure 1.1.2 is a schematic drawing of a heat engine. The
 yellow circle represents the heat engine consisting of a set of
 equipment.

 By examining Figure 1.1.2, you might notice that a certain amount of
 heat is not converted to work. It is true that not all of the heat from a
 heat source can be converted to useful work! Heat engines and their
 underlying principles are governed by the two fundamental laws of
 thermodynamics, the first and second laws of thermodynamics

 PROPERTIES OF A PURE
 SUBSTANCE</h2>
 <p style="background-color: rgb(24, 247, 247);">
Pure substance
 A pure substance refers to a matter that has a homogeneous and
 definite chemical composition. A pure substance may exist in a
 single phase, such as liquid water, ice, and CO2gas. It can also exist
 as a multi-phase mixture, such as a mixture of liquid water and
 water vapour in equilibrium.
 Air is a common working fluid used in many thermal devices.
 Can air be treated as a pure substance? Although air is a mixture
 consisting of roughly 78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, and trace
 amounts of other gases and moisture, air is homogeneous and has
 distinct properties without phase changes in its composition in
 many thermodynamic processes. In such conditions, we can treat
 air as a pure substance.

2.2 Thermodynamic
 properties
 Pure substances are widely used in thermodynamic cycles. For
 example, in the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle, Figure
 1.4.2, refrigerant R134a is used as the working fluid, which is
 circulated through a compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and
 evaporator via the connecting tubes.
 In steam power plants, water is used as the working fluid. Figure
 2.2.1 shows a coal-fired steam power plant. Purified water flows
 vertically up the tube-lined walls of the boiler, where it turns into
 steam. Steam flows into the boiler drum (17), separating from any
 remaining water, and then flows into the pendant superheater (19),
 where its temperature and pressure increase rapidly to around 200
 bar and 570°C. The superheated steam is piped to the high-pressure
 turbine (11), where both its pressure and temperature are reduced.
 The steam is then returned to the boiler reheater (21). After being
 reheated, it enters the intermediate-pressure turbine (9) and then
 the low-pressure turbine (6). The steam, now just above its boiling
 point, is brought into thermal contact with the cold water in the
 condenser (8), where it is condensed rapidly back into water. The
 water then passes a feed pump (7), a de-aerator (12), a feed heater
 (13), and an economizer (23) before being returned to the boiler
 drum.

<p style="color:white;background-color: black;">
Ideal gas and ideal gas
 equation of state
 Consider a container of fixed volume filled with a gas. When the
 container is heated, the gas temperature will increase, causing the
 gas pressure to increase. The variations of gas pressure and
 temperature are governed by the equations of state. An equation of
 state (EOS) is an expression that relates pressure, temperature, and
 specific volume of a gas.
 The simplest equation of state is the ideal gas equation of state,
 which is expressed as
 or
 where
 : mass, in kg
 : volume, in m3
 : specific volume, in m3/kg
 : absolute temperature, in K
 : pressure, in kPa or Pa
 :gas constant in kJ/kgK or J/kgK
 A gas which obeys the ideal gas EOS is called an ideal gas. The
 ideal gas model is a hypothetical model. It approximates the
 behaviourof a gas at high temperatures and low
 pressures in the superheated vapour region.
 When a gas is at a state near the saturation region or its critical
 point, the gas behaviour deviates from the ideal gas model
 significantly. For example, Figure 3.1.1 shows the diagram
 for water. Steam in the shaded region is either at a high
 temperature or a low pressure. The ideal gas model is valid in this
 region with a relative error of less than 1%. Moving out of the
 3.1 Ideal gas and ideal gas equation of
 state | 85
shaded region and towards the saturated vapour line or the critical
 point, the relative error increases significantly because the ideal gas
 EOS can no longer represent the gas behaviour in these regions.
 A common mistake that students tend to make is to use the ideal
 gas EOS in all calculations without evaluating its suitability for the
 given conditions. It is important to note that, although many gasses
 may be treated as ideal gases in a certain range of pressures and
 temperatures, the ideal gas EOS is NOT valid for gases in all
 conditions. Therefore, it cannot be used without verification. The
 compressibility factor in Section 3.2 explains how to verify if a gas is
 an “ideal” or real gas
