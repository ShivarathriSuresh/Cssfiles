<p style="color: blueviolet;background-color: aliceblue;">Mahi and Pluto cross paths with a lady, Yashna, who saves them from a traffic collision. At Mahi's request, Yashna invites Viraj to a restaurant. 
    There, Yashna and Mahi compel Viraj to reveal the story about the little girl's mother, "Varsha". To help Mahi relate to her father's narrative, Yashna suggests the child imagine herself as Varsha.
    Viraj reluctantly recounts the story of Varsha- ten years ago, Viraj, a struggling photographer, met Varsha in Coonoor and fell in love with her at first sight. Initially, Varsha was reluctant, because she did not believe in love due to her parents' divorce. However, she gradually reciprocated Viraj's feelings.
    Varsha's mother disapproved of the relationship due to Viraj's low financial status. Nevertheless, Varsha married Viraj, and the couple had a happy marriage despite the hardships. Eventually, Viraj and his friend, Justin, opened their own studio, becoming commercially successful photographers.</p>
